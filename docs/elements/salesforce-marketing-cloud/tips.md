### Tips

* The Salesforce Marketing Cloud is based on what was previously the Exact Target application.
* Note that there is currently a bug in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application such that created and modified times coming back that are returned from Salesforce are not valid.  Salesforce has acknowledged this issue but there is not currently a timeframe that they have committed to fix this.   Until they do, Events are not possible in this Element.   
* There is no GET Contacts API in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud API to get the list of Contacts.  Therefore, this functionality is not available today.
