## Setting Up Your Organization

### What to do First

__Create an account__ in the [Cloud Elements Developer Console](https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/signup.jsp)
Once you get logged into the Console, locate the `ADMINISTRATION` menu on the left hand side.

The Administration menu allows you to create accounts and user logins for your customers.

By clicking on the Accounts menu, you will get a list of each account that has been set up.  A single account would represent one of your customers.  Each account could then have multiple users, each belonging to that organization.
