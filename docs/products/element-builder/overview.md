### Elements Builder BETA

Element Builder gives you the ability to create custom integrations to cloud services using the Cloud Elements API Management Platform.  We are currently testing our BETA version.  __Currently only endpoints with a REST API can be built using Element Builder__.  Please [contact us](mailto:support@cloud-elements.com) if you are interested in participating in our round of BETA testing.

The Element Builder developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Element Creation via API](create-via-api.html)
* [Element Creation via the Element Builder UI](create-via-element-builder-ui.html)
* [Element Enhancement - adding resources, events, etc. to current Elements](enhance-existing-elements.html)
