### Elements Builder BETA

Element Builder gives you the ability to create custom integrations to cloud services using the Cloud Elements API Management Platform.  We are currently testing our BETA version.  __Currently only endpoints with a REST API can be built using Element Builder__.  Please [contact us](mailto:support@cloud-elements.com) if you are interested in participating in our round of BETA testing.

The Element Builder developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Element Creation via API](create-via-api.html)
* [Element Creation via the Element Builder UI](create-via-element-builder-ui.html)
* [Element Enhancement - adding resources, events, etc. to current Elements](enhance-existing-elements.html)

#### At a Glance

The Element Builder tool configures an Element and publishes it to your private Elements Catalog while automatically generating interactive API Documentation using Swagger 2.0. You can aggregate services by creating a Hub or mapping an Element to an existing Hub.

Using Element Builder, you can utilize the normalized resources that we have already organized into Hubs, and leverage the same resources across any other Element you build.

Element Builder is currently in BETA.  We would love to hear about enhancements or concerns regarding the application.  Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Need some help?  Don’t hesitate to reach out to [Cloud Elements Support](mailto:support@cloud-elements.com) with any questions or concerns.
