## Overview

The Ground2Cloud integration consists of two parts: Client and Server referred to by the name Tightrope.

The Tightrope Client creates a tunnel to a public Tightrope Server, and enables requests from the Cloud Elements Production Cloud to transparently pass through that tunnel to reach the Client Service.

The Ground2Cloud developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Who is this Manual for?](who-is-this-for.html)
* [How It Works](how-it-works.html)
* [Installer Types](installer-types.html)
* [Installing Tightrope](installing-tightrope.html)
* [Managing Tightrope](managing-tightrope.html)
