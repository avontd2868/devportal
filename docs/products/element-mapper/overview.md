### Overview

Element Mapper is an API and Data Mapping Application to map and transform data across leading cloud services.

#### Easily Define and Map Data

* Using Element Mapper is the easiest way to normalize objects across cloud services.
* To start, simply select the object you want to map and name the object with your custom name (e.g. “My Contacts”).
* Powerful UI: use our drag-and-drop UI to easily map services across the cloud services you are using.

The Element Mapper UI can be found in the Cloud Elements API Manger or you can call the APIs right from your app.

The Element Mapper developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.html)
* [Create Objects](create-objects.html)
* [Map and Transform Data via API](map-and-transform-data-via-api.html)
* [Customized JavaScript](customized-javascript.html)
* [Array Support](array-support.html)

View the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start-guide.html) to get familiar with the Element Mapper UI.
