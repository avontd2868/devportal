## Overview

The Ground2Cloud integration consists of two parts: Client and Server.

The Ground2Cloud Client creates a tunnel to a public Ground2Cloud Server, and enables requests from the Cloud Elements Production Cloud to transparently pass through that tunnel to reach the Client Service.

The Ground2Cloud developer docs are broken down into three guides:

* [Who is this Manual for?](who-is-this-for.html)
* [How It Works](how-it-works.html)
* [Installer Types](installer-types.html)
* [Installing Ground2Cloud](installing-ground2cloud.html)
* [Managing Ground2Cloud](managing-ground2cloud.html)
* [F.A.Q.](faq.html)

If you have any questions regarding the Ground2Cloud integration, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:support@cloud-elements.com).
