# Overview

Cloud Elements supports customizable workflows, called __formulas__.  Formulas are a user-defined workflow that has a trigger (incoming event, API request, timer, etc.) that, when triggered, will begin executing a series of steps.  These steps can go about accomplishing a large variety of different use cases across different services.  Some ways our customers are using them now include keeping their systems in sync, migrating data between systems, automating business workflows, and many more.
