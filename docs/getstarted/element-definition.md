## ELEMENTS DEFINED

An Element is a collection of resources providing a pre-built integration into a service endpoint. RESTful methods (POST, GET, UPDATE, PATCH, DELETE) are used to interact with these resources (accounts, contacts, files) regardless of the type of APIs (SOAP or REST) provided by the endpoint. Elements leverage Cloud Elements API Manager platform services including authentication, data transformation, and event management.

* Elements share common services including discovery, search query, pagination, bulk uploading and downloading, logging and interactive documentation.
* Methods are normalized and accessible through RESTful APIs
* Complete data payloads are returned in JSON and available to transform and normalize via the Cloud Elements API Manager Transformation Services.
* Cloud Elements keeps each Element up to date with changes at the endpoint.
* Each Elements is a “Multi-tenant” connector supporting an unlimited number of authenticated accounts with no additional code required.
