## What we do

Cloud Elements creates standardized APIs to a large variety of Cloud Services. Regardless of what the API looks like at the provider, you have access to a state of the art RESTful API.


## What to do First
1. Create an account in the [Console](https://console.cloud-elements.com/elements/jsp/signup.jsp)
  Once you get logged into the Console, look through the Elements Catalogue. This is a list of all the integrations we currently have separated out by hub.
2. Find an Element that you want to work with and Create an Instance. Just click 'Add Instance'
3. Provide any required configuration for that Element to connect to your account.
  For additional help with this please reference the [Element Specific Documentation](/docs/elements.html)
4. Click open the Documentation Tab
![Documentation Tab](http://cloud-elements.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HumanCapitalQuickStart5.png)

This documentation will show you all of the endpoints that are available for that Element.
Our documentation is interactive so click the try it out butting at the bottom of a given endpoint to see how it works and what it will return.
