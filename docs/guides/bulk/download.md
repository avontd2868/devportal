# Bulk Download

The Bulk download can be used to generate a csv or json file from a large number of records. Since the bulk download works asynchronously, two calls are required to download a file.

### 1. Create a Bulk Job
The `POST /bulk/query` creates a bulk job, which will build out a file in Cloud Elements. The records included in the file are based on the CEQL query used to generate the job. Since the job will take an unknown amount of time to complete, a callback url can also be included in the bulk job. When the job completes it will make a callback to the url. The query is composed of several parts:

- Headers:
  - `Elements-Async-Callback-Url`: The webhook to be notified when a job has completed
- Query:
  - `q` : A CEQL query for records to be included in the bulk job, i.e. `select * from contacts`

### 2. Download the Bulk File
Once the job generated from the `/bulk/query` call has completed, the `GET /bulk/{id}/{objectName}` can be used to download the file. The file can be downloaded as a `csv` or `json` file.

- Headers:
  - `Accept`: The format of the file to download, either `text/csv` or `application/json`
- Path:
  - `{id}`: the bulk job id generated by `POST /bulk/query`
  - `{objectName}`: the object name that was used to generate the bulk query
